## Abstract

Crowd Counting is a difficult but important problem in computer vision. Convolutional Neural Networks based on estimating the density map over the image has
been highly successful in this domain. However dense crowd counting remains an
open problem because of severe occlusion and perspective view in which people
can be present at various sizes. In this work, we propose a new network which
uses a ResNet based feature extractor, downsampling block which uses dilated
convolutions and upsampling block using transposed convolutions. We present a
novel aggregation module which makes our network robust to the perspective view
problem. We present the optimization details, loss functions and the algorithm
used in our work. On evaluating on ShanghaiTech, UCF-CC-50 and UCF-QNRF
datasets using MSE and MAE as evaluation metrics, our network outperforms previous state of the art approaches while giving uncertainty estimates in a principled
bayesian manner.

## Data:

The dataset can be downloaded from [ShanghaiTech](https://svip-lab.github.io/datasets.html), [UCF-CC-50](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/research/data-sets/ucf-cc-50/) and [UCF-QNRF](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/research/data-sets/ucf-qnrf/).
